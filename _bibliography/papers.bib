  title={Performance Modeling for Optimal Data Placement on GPU with Heterogeneous Memory Systems},
  abstract = {A heterogeneous memory system (HMS) consists of multiple memory components with different properties. GPU is a representative architecture with HMS. It is challenging to decide optimal placement of data objects on HMS because of the large exploration space and complicated memory hierarchy on HMS. In this paper, we introduce performance modeling techniques to predict performance of various data placements on GPU. In essence, our models quantify and capture implicit performance correlation between different data placements. Given the memory access information and performance of a sample data placement, our models predict performance for other data placements based on the quantified correlation. We reveal critical performance factors that cause performance variation across data placements. Those factors include instruction replay, addressing mode, hardware queuing delay of memory requests, off-chip memory access latency, and caching effects. Those factors, which are often not sufficiently considered in the existing performance models, can significantly impact modeling accuracy. We introduce a series of techniques to model those factors. We extensively evaluate our models with a variety of benchmarks with various data placements. Our models are able to quantitatively predict the benefit or performance loss of data placements.},

abstract = {Non-volatile memory (NVM) provides a scalable and power-efficient solution to replace DRAM as main memory. However, because of relatively high latency and low bandwidth of NVM, NVM is often paired with DRAM to build a heterogeneous memory system (HMS). As a result, data objects of the application must be carefully placed to NVM and DRAM for best performance. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight runtime solution that automatically and transparently manage data placement on HMS without the requirement of hardware modifications and disruptive change to applications. Leveraging online profiling and performance models, the runtime characterizes memory access patterns associated with data objects, and minimizes unnecessary data movement. Our runtime solution effectively bridges the performance gap between NVM and DRAM. We demonstrate that using NVM to replace the majority of DRAM can be a feasible solution for future HPC systems with the assistance of a software-based data management.},
